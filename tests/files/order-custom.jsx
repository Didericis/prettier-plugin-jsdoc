	/**
	 * Returns an object which provides methods to get the ids of the components which have to be loaded (`getIds`) and
	 * a way to efficiently load them in synchronously and asynchronous contexts (`load`).
	 *
	 * The set of ids to be loaded is a superset of `load`. If some of these ids are in `loaded`, the corresponding
	 * components will have to reloaded.
	 *
	 * The ids in `load` and `loaded` may be in any order and can contain duplicates.
	 *
	 * @param {Components} components
	 * @param {string[]} load
	 * @param {string[]} [loaded=[]] A list of already loaded components.
	 *
	 * If a component is in this list, then all of its requirements will also be assumed to be in the list.
	 * @returns {Loader}
	 *
	 * @typedef Loader
	 * @property {() => string[]} getIds A function to get all ids of the components to load.
	 *
	 * The returned ids will be duplicate-free, alias-free and in load order.
	 * @property {LoadFunction} load A functional interface to load components.
	 *
	 * @typedef {<T> (loadComponent: (id: string) => T, chainer?: LoadChainer<T>) => T} LoadFunction
	 * A functional interface to load components.
	 *
	 * The `loadComponent` function will be called for every component in the order in which they have to be loaded.
	 *
	 * The `chainer` is useful for asynchronous loading and its `series` and `parallel` functions can be thought of as
	 * `Promise#then` and `Promise.all`.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * load(id => { loadComponent(id); }); // returns undefined
	 *
	 * await load(
	 *     id => loadComponentAsync(id), // returns a Promise for each id
	 *     {
	 *         series: async (before, after) => {
	 *             await before;
	 *             await after();
	 *         },
	 *         parallel: async (values) => {
	 *             await Promise.all(values);
	 *         }
	 *     }
	 * );
